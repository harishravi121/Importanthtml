These codes can be embedded into your webpage. A sum product etc and other problems changing every mind or paper calculable 10-20 seconds would be great for all. Recommend many universities and school to use those codes..

These are upto class X level code! I can do more advanced code if I get an opportunity..

Another important thing to do I wish is to join everything (or most)  educational like sum, product, interest etc into one html for faster loading from PC or smarphone by direct sharing of file instead of a google site.

Sum delay is best where it excercises us to calculate the answer without revealing. All calculations can be made with a second copy of delay.
