**Key Improvements:**

*   **Self-Contained:** The PDB data is directly embedded in the HTML file as a string using a template literal (backticks). This eliminates the need for a separate file or fetching from a server.
*   **Simplified Code:** The code removes the parsing step since the PDB data is readily available as a string.
*   **Library Inclusion:** The NGL library is directly included from a CDN, making it easier to get started without downloading and setting up the library manually.



**How to Use:**

1.  **Replace PDB Data:** Replace the placeholder `pdbData` with your actual protein structure data in PDB format.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Save this code as an HTML file (e.g., `protein_viewer.html`) and open it in your web browser. You should see your protein structure rotating at 10 RPM.
